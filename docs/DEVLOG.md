# Foundry Development Log

## 2026-07-16 — Milestone 0: discovery and Phase 1 proposal

### Work completed

- Inspected the repository, branch, remote, history, tracked files, README, and existing ignore rules.
- Confirmed that the repository started clean with no application code or experiment artifacts.
- Researched three model/domain/benchmark/verifier combinations using official model cards, benchmark repositories, and benchmark papers.
- Recommended GSM1K arithmetic reasoning with `Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct`, pending user approval.
- Documented the proposed architecture, evaluation firewall, data loop, milestones, metrics, risks, unresolved questions, learning notes, and experiment-record template.
- Extended the existing Python `.gitignore` with the requested local data and large-artifact paths.

### Files changed

- `.gitignore`
- `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md`
- `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- `docs/DEVLOG.md`
- `docs/LEARNING_NOTES.md`
- `experiments/EXPERIMENTS.md`

### Commands run

Repository inspection:

```text
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
git status --short --branch
git remote -v
git log --oneline --decorate -5
find . -maxdepth 3 -type f -not -path './.git/*' -print | sort
sed -n '1,320p' README.md
sed -n '1,360p' .gitignore
```

Documentation setup:

```text
mkdir -p docs experiments
```

Research was performed through the public official pages linked from `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md`; no API generation job was run.

Verification commands:

```text
test -s <each required documentation file>
grep -Fqx <each required .gitignore rule> .gitignore
grep -Fqx <each required heading> <documentation file>
git diff --check
rg -n <credential and private-key patterns> .gitignore docs experiments README.md
git status --short
git diff --stat
git config user.name
git config user.email
git log -1 --format='%an <%ae>'
git add .gitignore docs experiments/EXPERIMENTS.md
git diff --cached --check
git diff --cached --name-status
git -c user.name=KavinSivaharan -c user.email=140466612+KavinSivaharan@users.noreply.github.com commit -m "docs: define Foundry phase 1 research plan"
```

The configured email was the placeholder `your.email@example.com`. The commit therefore uses the GitHub noreply identity already present on the repository's initial commit, scoped to this one command. Repository and global Git configuration are not changed.

### Tests performed

- No model, dataset, training, or application test was run because no implementation exists and the initial task forbids training.
- Required files: passed; every requested file exists and is non-empty.
- Required `.gitignore` rules: passed.
- Required `PROJECT_PLAN.md` and `LEARNING_NOTES.md` sections: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed with no whitespace errors.
- Secret-pattern scan: passed with no credential or private-key patterns found.
- Model, dataset, training, and application tests: not run because no implementation exists and the initial task forbids training.

### Outputs and results

- Measured benchmark score: not available.
- Training result: not available.
- API/cloud cost: $0.
- Proposed combination: GSM1K + `Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct` + exact integer scoring and independent executable verification for synthetic labels.

### Failures or blockers

- The target RTX 3080 VRAM capacity, OS, CUDA version, driver, and free disk are not yet confirmed.
- Exact model, dataset, and package revisions are intentionally unpinned until the proposed evaluation-foundation milestone is approved.
- Memory and runtime figures are estimates, not measurements.

### Next action

Stop and wait for explicit approval or revision of the recommendation. If approved, propose and execute only Milestone 1: the reproducible evaluation foundation and a maximum 10-example smoke evaluation, with no training or full benchmark run.

## 2026-07-16 — Milestone 1: reproducible evaluation foundation

### Work completed

- Inspected the current machine before implementation.
- Confirmed that the machine is an Apple Silicon Mac, not the RTX 3080 desktop, and ruled out a real CUDA smoke run.
- Used the existing Python 3.12.11 installation to create an isolated `.venv`; did not modify system Python, Homebrew, or Conda.
- Used pip-tools because `uv` was not installed. Created exact development and optional smoke dependency locks.
- Verified the current immutable Hugging Face Git revisions for the selected Qwen model and GSM1K dataset.
- Implemented typed YAML configuration loading with strict keys, immutable revision validation, deterministic decoding enforcement, and stable configuration hashing.
- Implemented deterministic manifest construction using hash-ranked pinned row identities.
- Created:
  - 904-example development manifest, SHA-256 `d2c895f43a1e76a12796d6a263b60dc230a9abab58f9624674ec925f37319fae`;
  - 301-example sealed-final manifest, SHA-256 `b0dd1077ad443fc2f9ef31e8ea3d95faa604dff52b3071eaf552827a674308b2`.
- Verified that manifests are exhaustive, disjoint, deterministic, internally signed, configuration-bound, and free of questions and answers.
- Implemented stable two-message prompt rendering and prompt SHA-256 `738ea5a3b94e7c75ac0bd50a229bbf04f3fc5d773e14658bc6728bc7a4b18350`.
- Implemented strict final-integer extraction and scoring.
- Implemented a synthetic fixture loader, fake model backend, pinned Hugging Face dataset loader, optional CUDA model backend, evaluation runner, raw JSONL records, aggregate JSON summaries, runtime/throughput/token accounting, and peak CUDA VRAM measurement hooks.
- Implemented CLI commands:
  - `foundry validate-config`
  - `foundry build-manifests`
  - `foundry evaluate-fixture`
  - `foundry smoke`
- Added unit and integration coverage, including a complete fake-model run with no GPU or download.
- Exercised the CUDA preflight; it refused before network/model access on the ineligible Mac.
- Did not train, generate synthetic data, implement GRPO, run a full benchmark, use paid APIs/clouds, or push.

### Detected environment

- **Operating system:** macOS 15.6.1, build 24G90; Darwin 24.6.0 arm64.
- **CPU/GPU platform:** Apple M2; built-in 10-core Apple GPU; no NVIDIA GPU.
- **Memory:** 8 GB unified memory.
- **System Python:** 3.9.6 at `/usr/bin/python3`.
- **Project Python:** 3.12.11 at `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12`.
- **NVIDIA driver:** unavailable; `nvidia-smi` not installed.
- **CUDA toolkit/runtime:** unavailable; `nvcc` not installed.
- **Free disk at inspection:** approximately 14 GiB on `/System/Volumes/Data`.
- **uv:** not installed.
- **Real-model smoke suitability:** unsuitable. No NVIDIA CUDA device is present, memory is limited, and the remaining disk margin is poor for an unnecessary local model cache.

```

The smoke command returned exit code 2 with `CUDA smoke evaluation requires the pinned 'smoke' optional dependencies`. This is the intended pre-download refusal on a non-CUDA machine; no results directory or model/dataset cache was produced by Foundry.

### Tests performed

- Initial check: 29 tests collected, 23 passed and 6 failed.
- Initial failures:
  - manifest construction accidentally converted typed entries into dictionaries;
  - one test string contained a literal backslash-n;
  - strict typing required the PyYAML stub package;
  - formatting and an import modernization were pending.
- All failures were fixed without changing the milestone architecture or weakening validation.
- Final framework check before documentation closeout:
  - Ruff formatting: passed.
  - Ruff linting: passed.
  - Mypy strict type checking: passed for 10 source files.
  - Pytest: 29 passed.
  - Fake-model integration: passed with 3 synthetic examples, 2 correct, 1 intentionally invalid, and no GPU/download.
- Final closeout:
  - Unit tests: 28 passed.
  - Integration tests: 1 passed.
  - Dependency integrity with `pip check`: passed.
  - Fresh temporary Python 3.12 environment installed from `requirements-dev.lock.txt`: passed; all 29 tests passed again.
  - `git diff --check`: passed.
  - Secrets scan: passed.
  - Manifest-content scan for `question` or `answer` fields: passed.
  - Candidate repository file-size review: passed; no non-ignored milestone file exceeds 1 MiB.
  - Repository status review: only the approved Milestone 1 source, tests, configuration, manifests, locks, and documentation were changed.

### Outputs and results

- **Evaluation config SHA-256:** `2a6e737cf3376ae081fd17600e31937824830ecdbb624644e729f6b5752f8eba`.
- **Development examples:** 904.
- **Sealed-final examples:** 301.
- **Fake integration score:** 2/3 on intentionally synthetic test records; this is a software assertion, not a model benchmark.
- **Real-model smoke score:** not measured.
- **Real-model throughput:** not measured.
- **Peak GPU VRAM:** not measured.
- **API/cloud cost:** $0.
- **Downloaded model/dataset artifacts:** none.

### Exact RTX 3080 setup and smoke command

For Linux Bash with Python 3.12 and a driver compatible with CUDA 12.1:

```text
python3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip==25.1.1
.venv/bin/python -m pip install torch==2.5.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements-smoke.lock.txt
.venv/bin/python -m pip install --no-deps -e .
.venv/bin/python -c "import torch; assert torch.cuda.is_available(); print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))"
HF_HOME=data/huggingface .venv/bin/foundry smoke --config configs/eval/gsm1k_qwen2_5_1_5b_smoke.yaml --manifest configs/eval/manifests/gsm1k_development.json --output-dir results/smoke/qwen2_5_1_5b --limit 10
```

For Windows PowerShell, use `py -3.12 -m venv .venv`, replace `.venv/bin/python` with `.venv\Scripts\python.exe`, replace `.venv/bin/foundry` with `.venv\Scripts\foundry.exe`, and set `$env:HF_HOME = "data/huggingface"` before the same smoke arguments.

Do not run the smoke if `nvidia-smi` does not show the RTX 3080, the CUDA assertion fails, or disk space is insufficient for the roughly 3 GB model plus cache/runtime overhead.

### Failures or blockers

- The RTX 3080 desktop's OS, VRAM size, NVIDIA driver, CUDA compatibility, RAM, and free disk remain unknown because that machine is not connected to this task.
- The real CUDA code path and target-platform smoke lock have not been executed on NVIDIA hardware.
- The benchmark loader depends on the public pinned Hub revision remaining retrievable.
- No accuracy, throughput, or peak-VRAM claim is possible until the deferred smoke runs.

### Next action

Stop after the local Milestone 1 commit. The recommended next decision is to open this repository on the RTX 3080 desktop and explicitly authorize the deferred 10-example CUDA smoke. Review that result before approving Milestone 2, which would establish the base model's development benchmark and failure inventory.
