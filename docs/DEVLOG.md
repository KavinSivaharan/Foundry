# Foundry Development Log

## 2026-07-16 — Milestone 0: discovery and Phase 1 proposal

### Work completed

- Inspected the repository, branch, remote, history, tracked files, README, and existing ignore rules.
- Confirmed that the repository started clean with no application code or experiment artifacts.
- Researched three model/domain/benchmark/verifier combinations using official model cards, benchmark repositories, and benchmark papers.
- Recommended GSM1K arithmetic reasoning with `Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct`, pending user approval.
- Documented the proposed architecture, evaluation firewall, data loop, milestones, metrics, risks, unresolved questions, learning notes, and experiment-record template.
- Extended the existing Python `.gitignore` with the requested local data and large-artifact paths.

### Files changed

- `.gitignore`
- `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md`
- `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- `docs/DEVLOG.md`
- `docs/LEARNING_NOTES.md`
- `experiments/EXPERIMENTS.md`

### Commands run

Repository inspection:

```text
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
git status --short --branch
git remote -v
git log --oneline --decorate -5
find . -maxdepth 3 -type f -not -path './.git/*' -print | sort
sed -n '1,320p' README.md
sed -n '1,360p' .gitignore
```

Documentation setup:

```text
mkdir -p docs experiments
```

Research was performed through the public official pages linked from `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md`; no API generation job was run.

Verification commands:

```text
test -s <each required documentation file>
grep -Fqx <each required .gitignore rule> .gitignore
grep -Fqx <each required heading> <documentation file>
git diff --check
rg -n <credential and private-key patterns> .gitignore docs experiments README.md
git status --short
git diff --stat
git config user.name
git config user.email
git log -1 --format='%an <%ae>'
git add .gitignore docs experiments/EXPERIMENTS.md
git diff --cached --check
git diff --cached --name-status
git -c user.name=KavinSivaharan -c user.email=140466612+KavinSivaharan@users.noreply.github.com commit -m "docs: define Foundry phase 1 research plan"
```

The configured email was the placeholder `your.email@example.com`. The commit therefore uses the GitHub noreply identity already present on the repository's initial commit, scoped to this one command. Repository and global Git configuration are not changed.

### Tests performed

- No model, dataset, training, or application test was run because no implementation exists and the initial task forbids training.
- Required files: passed; every requested file exists and is non-empty.
- Required `.gitignore` rules: passed.
- Required `PROJECT_PLAN.md` and `LEARNING_NOTES.md` sections: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed with no whitespace errors.
- Secret-pattern scan: passed with no credential or private-key patterns found.
- Model, dataset, training, and application tests: not run because no implementation exists and the initial task forbids training.

### Outputs and results

- Measured benchmark score: not available.
- Training result: not available.
- API/cloud cost: $0.
- Proposed combination: GSM1K + `Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct` + exact integer scoring and independent executable verification for synthetic labels.

### Failures or blockers

- The target RTX 3080 VRAM capacity, OS, CUDA version, driver, and free disk are not yet confirmed.
- Exact model, dataset, and package revisions are intentionally unpinned until the proposed evaluation-foundation milestone is approved.
- Memory and runtime figures are estimates, not measurements.

### Next action

Stop and wait for explicit approval or revision of the recommendation. If approved, propose and execute only Milestone 1: the reproducible evaluation foundation and a maximum 10-example smoke evaluation, with no training or full benchmark run.
